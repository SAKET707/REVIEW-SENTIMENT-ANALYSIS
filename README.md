  - Handling emojis, hashtags, mentions, and punctuations like `!`, `?`

### ✅ Engineered Metadata Features
- `mojibake_freq` — count of mojibake and special characters
- `has_mojibake` — binary indicator
- `review_char`, `review_words`, `review_sent` — text statistics
- `repetition_score` — proportion of repeated words
- `max_word_repeat_ratio` — max single word frequency ratio
- `sentiment_score`, POS-tag counts
